# üëã Hi, I'm Valiant ‚Äì Cybersecurity Specialist | SOC Analyst 

I specialize in protecting digital infrastructure through **threat detection**, **incident response**, **malware analysis**, and **security automation**. My core strength is combining hands-on detection skills with tools like **Azure Sentinel**, **Qualys**, **Wireshark**, **Active Directory**, and **PowerShell** to design actionable, real-time security defenses for businesses and government entities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity & Blue Team Projects

### üîê Deception-Based Threat Detection
- **[Canary Tokens ‚Äì Honeypots for Unauthorized Access Detection](https://github.com/Vluthor/Canary-Tokens)**  
  Deployed CanaryTokens inside decoy Word docs to detect and track unauthorized access attempts. Captured detailed attacker metadata including IP address, timestamp, and geolocation ‚Äî showcasing early-stage threat detection through deception-based defense.

- **[Endpoint Threat Hunting ‚Äì Persistence, PsExec, and Credential Access](https://github.com/Vluthor/-Endpoint-Threat-Hunting)**  
  Used Elastic Stack to detect scheduled tasks, PsExec lateral movement, and LSASS access. Wrote KQL queries, analyzed process behavior, and mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK. Focused on visibility into attacker movement and detection across endpoints.

### üß¨ Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering
- **[Oski Malware Analysis ‚Äì Behavioral Breakdown of Stealc Variant](https://github.com/Vluthor/Oski-Malware-Analysis-)**  
  Conducted full sandbox analysis of Oski/Stealc malware using ANY.RUN and VirusTotal. Discovered RC4 decryption keys, C2 servers, and self-deletion behavior. Mapped activity to **MITRE ATT&CK T1555 ‚Äì Credential from Password Stores**, with IOC documentation and screenshots.

### üì° Threat Intelligence & Incident Analysis
- **[Phishing Email Analysis & Defensive Playbooks](https://github.com/Vluthor/Phishing-Email-Analysis-and-Defensive-Measures)**  
  Broke down a real phishing email with header forensics, malware hash scanning, and remediation. Built defensive layers using filtering rules, domain reputation tools, and custom SOC-level response steps.

- **[Threat Detection SOC Analysis](https://github.com/Vluthor/Threat-Detection-SOC-Analysis)**  
  Reviewed 2022 detection trends including ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, and PrintNightmare. Documented adversary behaviors from Gootkit, Yellow Cockatoo, and others. Created detection rules and blue team response strategies.

- **[OSSEC File Integrity Monitoring & Log4Shell Detection](https://github.com/Vluthor/OSSEC-File-Integrity-Monitoring)**  
  Configured OSSEC HIDS to detect file tampering and monitor system modifications. Used Nessus to scan for Log4Shell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228). Strengthened alerting through ruleset customization and log correlation.

---

### üåê Network & Forensics Analysis
- **[Network Forensics with Wireshark & Zui](https://github.com/Vluthor/Network-Forensics-Analysis-with-Wireshark-and-Zui)**  
  Investigated real-world network traffic using PCAP analysis in Wireshark and Suricata/Zui. Identified IOCs, malware payloads, C2 communications, and exfiltration events. Focused on translating raw traffic into attacker timelines.

---

### üè¢ Enterprise Security & Automation
- **[Active Directory Home Lab ‚Äì AD Attack & Defense Simulation](https://github.com/Vluthor/Active-Directory-Lab)**  
  Built a virtual enterprise AD network to simulate privilege escalation and policy abuse. Implemented Group Policy hardening, user privilege audits, and SIEM log correlation to detect anomalies.

- **[Azure Sentinel SIEM ‚Äì Cloud-Based Detection Lab](https://github.com/Vluthor/SIEM-Azure-Sentinel-Lab)**  
  Deployed Azure Sentinel and configured custom alert rules for cloud-based threat detection. Integrated multiple log sources to build real-time dashboards and generate detections mapped to ATT&CK.
