# üëã I‚Äôm Valiant. I build detections that expose real threats

My labs and projects reflect how threats operate in real environments and how defenders should shut them down fast

## üî• Detection Labs and Projects

### üéØ Threat Detection and Hunting

- **[Canary Tokens for Early Threat Traps](https://github.com/Vluthor/Canary-Tokens)**  
  Tracked unauthorized access using embedded canary links and decoy documents. Captured attacker metadata instantly for SOC-level visibility

- **[Endpoint Threat Hunting with Elastic](https://github.com/Vluthor/Endpoint-Threat-Hunting)**  
  Detected LSASS access, scheduled task persistence, and PsExec lateral movement. Used KQL to map attacker actions with clear detection logic

- **[Threat Detection SOC Analysis](https://github.com/Vluthor/Threat-Detection-SOC-Analysis)**  
  Documented real-world threat activity from campaigns like ProxyShell, PrintNightmare, and Gootkit. Built detection strategies mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

---

### üß† Malware and Forensics

- **[Oski Stealc Malware Analysis](https://github.com/Vluthor/Oski-Malware-Analysis)**  
  Identified self-deletion routines, RC4 encryption behavior, and credential harvesting from password stores. Mapped activity to threat techniques

- **[Network Forensics with Wireshark and Zui](https://github.com/Vluthor/Network-Forensics-Analysis-with-Wireshark-and-Zui)**  
  Investigated real PCAPs to extract IOCs, detect C2 traffic, and track attacker movement through the network using Zeek and Suricata

- **[Phishing Investigation ‚Äì Threat Intelligence Tools](https://github.com/Vluthor/Phishing-Investigation-THM)**  
  Analyzed spoofed LinkedIn phishing emails using `.eml` files. Extracted sender IPs, header metadata, and malicious payloads. Confirmed malware via VirusTotal and mapped IOCs for SOC visibility

- **[Phishing Email Analysis and Defensive Measures](https://github.com/Vluthor/Phishing-Email-Analysis-and-Defensive-Measures)**  
  Analyzed phishing headers, traced malicious links, and created layered defense playbooks for SOC teams

---

### üè¢ Enterprise Simulation and Security Automation

- **[Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/Vluthor/Active-Directory-Lab)**  
  Simulated privilege escalation and policy abuse in a live AD network. Hardened GPO settings and tested log visibility across endpoints

- **[Azure Sentinel SIEM Detection Lab](https://github.com/Vluthor/SIEM-Azure-Sentinel-Lab)**  
  Created custom alert rules for cloud-based incidents. Integrated log sources and visualized detection paths in real time

- **[OSSEC File Integrity Monitoring](https://github.com/Vluthor/OSSEC-File-Integrity-Monitoring)**  
  Detected unauthorized file changes and scanned for Log4Shell. Customized alert rules and log correlation to strengthen visibility
